As a result of this deal that was struck with NBC so many years ago, it is estimated that Larry has made $800 million from 'Seinfeld' alone. However, Larry is also an owner of 'Curb Your Enthusiasm'. And with the series ending in 2024, it will likely go into syndication shortly after the conclusion. When it does, that will make Larry an impressive sum of money and at that time, it will be clear if 'Seinfeld' will be the sitcom that made Larry his money or if 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' will be the cash cow for the comedian.</p><h2 id=larry-david-39-s-income-from-seinfeld>Larry David's Income From Seinfeld</h2><h3 id=larry-david-has-earned-nearly-800-million-from-seinfeld>Larry David has earned nearly $800 million from Seinfeld</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/larry-david-on-the-red-carpet-1.jpg><p>Larry David has earned himself a net worth of $450 million over the years, according to CelebrityNetWorth.

This is because <strong>Larry is paid between $40 and $50 million each year from royalties, merchandise, DVD sales, and syndication of the popular '90s sitcom</strong>. So far, as a result of owning 15% of the backend points from Seinfeld, Larry has earned an impressive $800 million.</p><p>More money was made in 2015 when Hulu bought the streaming rights for Seinfeld for $180 million. This earned Larry $80 million from that deal alone. And with a second deal with Netflix, who has secured the rights to Seinfeld until at least 2026, more money was made by Larry still, as <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">the deal netted him $75 million</a>.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/this-is-the-one-thing-seinfeld-got-wrong-in-the-finale-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>This Is The One Thing Seinfeld Got Wrong In The Finale</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>The Seinfeld finale took some creative license with one part of the episode, making the entire thing unbelievable.</span><h2 id=larry-david-39-s-income-from-curb-your-enthusiasm>Larry David's Income From Curb Your Enthusiasm</h2><h3 id=larry-david-stands-to-earn-a-huge-payday-after-curb-your-enthusiasm-ends-in-2024>Larry David stands to earn a huge payday after Curb Your Enthusiasm ends in 2024</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/instar48658239-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Larry's role in Curb Your Enthusiasm is that of the writer, creator, and lead actor.

This is because of a divorce he went through that caused a portion of his fortune to be handed over in the settlement.</p><p>According to Deadline, Larry went on 60 Minutes, stating, "I don’t have that kind of money! My wife took half of it in the divorce. The figures are crazy."</p><p>Charlie Rose mentioned on his talk show that people say that Larry has taken home more than $500 million because of Seinfeld syndication. Larry replied, "That’s just nuts! No, it’s not! It’s not! And mind your own d*mn business!"</p><p>According to The Globe and Mail, Jason Alexander said, "Julia, Michael and I, during our big renegotiation for the final year, asked for something that I will go to my grave saying we should have had, and that is back-end participation in the profits for the show. It was categorically denied to us, which forced us to then ask for ungodly salaries. We make very little, standard Screen Actors Guild residuals for the reruns."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It sounds like from what Jason said, Seinfeld makes a lot of money in reruns, and Larry and Jerry are the ones making the most cash from these, according to Cheat Sheet.</p><h2 id=the-curb-your-enthusiasm-and-seinfeld-comparison>The Curb Your Enthusiasm And Seinfeld Comparison</h2><h3 id=fans-have-compared-larry-david-39-s-shows-curb-your-enthusiasm-and-seinfeld-for-years>Fans have compared Larry David's shows Curb Your Enthusiasm and Seinfeld for years</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/instar48444253-1.jpg><p>Curb Your Enthusiasm premiered in 2000. The show has been extremely successful over the years with a very loyal audience. However, the decision was made that Season 12 will be the last for the sitcom. As such, 2024 will be when Curb Your Enthusiasm comes to an end.</p><p>In some ways, the show can be compared to Seinfeld as it is also "a show about nothing." Curb, however, is known for being a bit harsher and more blunt than Seinfeld ever was.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When asked in an interview with NPR if he was upset that people thought of him as an "insensitive jerk" because of his character on Curb, Larry said, "Oh, God, no, not at all. Why - no because that's - doesn't bother me in the least. I'm quite happy about it. I'm way closer to being the guy on 'Curb' than the guy who's talking to you right now."</p><p>Larry went on to explain that he thought his character on Curb was "nice" and he's "honest" which doesn't necessarily make him a mean character. Larry said, "I think he's expressing a lot of the things that many people think about."</p><p>It may not be clear just how much Larry is worth these days as his calculations are clearly different from what has been calculated from his earnings on Seinfeld and Curb Your Enthusiasm. But, what is clear is that for now, Seinfeld is what has earned Larry the lion's share of his wealth. A fact that may change once Curb Your Enthusiasm goes into syndication. Only time will tell.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Source: Deadline, Charlie Rose, The Globe and Mail, CheatSheet, NPR</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIyonWakkae%2FunnDmq2inKNiu6bAjLCmq6yYYrCwucSsZJ%2Bqn6J6pMHRm2Syp6Wneqa606GsrKGRqLpw</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhow-much-of-larry-davids-net-worth-comes-from-curb-your-enthusiasm.html&text=How%20Much%20of%20Larry%20David%27s%20Net%20Worth%20Comes%20From%20%27Curb%20Your%20Enthusiasm%27&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-much-of-larry-davids-net-worth-comes-from-curb-your-enthusiasm.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-much-of-larry-davids-net-worth-comes-from-curb-your-enthusiasm.html&title=How%20Much%20of%20Larry%20David%27s%20Net%20Worth%20Comes%20From%20%27Curb%20Your%20Enthusiasm%27" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhow-much-of-larry-davids-net-worth-comes-from-curb-your-enthusiasm.html&title=How%20Much%20of%20Larry%20David%27s%20Net%20Worth%20Comes%20From%20%27Curb%20Your%20Enthusiasm%27" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhow-much-of-larry-davids-net-worth-comes-from-curb-your-enthusiasm.html&title=How%20Much%20of%20Larry%20David%27s%20Net%20Worth%20Comes%20From%20%27Curb%20Your%20Enthusiasm%27" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-much-of-larry-davids-net-worth-comes-from-curb-your-enthusiasm.html&description=How%20Much%20of%20Larry%20David%27s%20Net%20Worth%20Comes%20From%20%27Curb%20Your%20Enthusiasm%27" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./mac-miller-family-rooting-for-cardi-b-if-he-doesnt-win-grammy.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mac Miller Family 'Rooting for Cardi B' If He Doesn't Win Grammy">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ari-fournier-bio-age-net-worth-profession.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ari Fournier Bio, Age, Net Worth, Profession">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
