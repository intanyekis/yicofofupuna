But what about the people behind the story? <a href=#>Screenwriters</a> are the ones responsible for the stories in your favorite movies and who create the movies on paper before they are on a screen. They turn an idea into a full story that entertains and inspires everyone who watches it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Writer Christopher Yost Throws Shade At Anti-Maskers On Spiderman Anniversary</a></span></p><p>The whole reason for movies to be made is to tell stories that make people feel something, so movies wouldn't even exist without the people who write the script. Sometimes directors help with the writing, but the <a href=#>screenwriters</a> still have the responsibility of fleshing out everything in the story. From <strong>Jane Goldman</strong> to <strong>Adam McKay</strong>, here are 10 of the richest screenwriters in Hollywood, ranked by their current net worth.</p><h2 id=jane-goldman---net-worth-7-million><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Jane Goldman - Net Worth: $7 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jane Goldman is in tenth place with $7 million and sadly the only female screenwriter on our list. She started out as a journalist, but began writing scripts and producing films in the early 2000’s. According to GOBankingRates, “Unless you're a Hollywood insider, you might not be familiar with the name Jane Goldman, but you definitely know her work. As a writer, she's credited on an impressive list of films, such as Kingsman: The Golden Circle, Kick-Ass, and multiple X-Men films, including X-Men: First Class."</p><h2 id=shane-black---net-worth-16-million><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Shane Black - Net Worth: $16 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shane Black is in ninth place with a net worth of $16 million. But success isn’t new to him. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Industrial Scripts</a>, “His introduction to Hollywood at 26 years old with the Lethal Weapon screenplay came with a $250k price tag. Black also scored $1.75m for The Last Boy Scout, and broke records at the time with the $4m sale of The Long Kiss Goodnight. Shane was also behind the gargantuan haul for Iron Man 3, co-written with British screenwriter Drew Pearce. This film ranks 20th as the highest grossing film worldwide.”</p><h2 id=terry-rossio---net-worth-20-million><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Terry Rossio - Net Worth: $20 Million</span></h2><p>Terry Rossio is in eighth place with only about $4 million more than Shane Black. It’s not clear what exactly his net worth is today, but it’s possibly around $20 million. “As per some online sources, his net worth is estimated to be around $20 million. Similarly, he also gets a good sum of money of $750 thousand to $3 million per movie from his writing credits,” according to Bio Gossip. Terry has written classics such as Aladdin, Men in Black, Godzilla, Shrek, Pirates of the Caribbean, National Treasure, and Déjà Vu, which earned him about $5 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Batman And Robin Writer Apologizes About The Movie's Bad Quality</a></span></p><h2 id=david-koepp---net-worth-35-million><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>David Koepp - Net Worth: $35 Million</span></h2><p>David Koepp is in seventh place with a net worth of $35 million. “David has had countless Hollywood successes, which has left him ranking as one of the most successful and highest paid screenwriters in the industry. He has made quite a name for himself as both a screenwriter and director, since he first started out in the industry in 1988,” according to Industrial Scripts. He has written legendary hit movies such as Jurassic Park, Spider Man, War of the Worlds, Mission: Impossible, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, and Panic Room, which earned him about $3 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=adam-mckay---net-worth-40-million><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Adam McKay - Net Worth: $40 Million</span></h2><p>Adam McKay is in sixth place with $40 million and is responsible for writing some of the most popular comedies of the last decade. He works with Will Ferrell all the time and wrote many of the hit movies that made Will famous. According to Industrial Scripts, “After the success of Anchorman, Talladega Nights earned McKay a writers fee of $4m shared between himself and Ferrell. McKay would go on to pen the screenplays of several more huge hits. This includes: Step Brothers, Ant-Man, and the Big Short.”</p><h2 id=aaron-sorkin---net-worth-90-million><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Aaron Sorkin - Net Worth: $90 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aaron Sorkin is in fifth place with a net worth of $90 million. Although he wrote the scripts for some movies, he made a lot of his money from TV shows. According to Celebrity Net Worth, “Aaron Sorkin is famous for writing many successful films, plays and television series. His probably most famous and critically acclaimed TV series is The West Wing, which ran on NBC from 1999 to 2006. Other Sorkin credits include Moneyball, The Newsroom, Steve Jobs, and Sports Night.”</p><h2 id=joss-whedon---net-worth-100-million><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Joss Whedon - Net Worth: $100 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Joss Whedon is in fourth place with only $10 million more than Aaron Sorkin. He’s made his money from writing multiple DC and Marvel films. According to Industrial Scripts, “Joss made his name in TV fantasy circles with Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Firefly, and Dollhouse. Whedon also landed the directing gig that brought together Marvel’s various Avengers. That world-beater, in combination with Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D, led to an alleged $100m five year deal with Disney—including Avengers 2 and several TV series.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Simpsons' Writers Must Have A Crystal Ball, Because They Predicted Real Life Events (17 Photos)</a></span></p><h2 id=david-e-kelley---net-worth-250-million><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>David E.

Kelley is in third place with a net worth of $250 million. “He is famous for meeting with writing teams just for story ideas, then jotting out entire solo episodes on his famed yellow legal notepad. The ‘credit’ is everything for the screenwriter's pay. David has racked up hundreds of TV episodes over the years, a rare feat in a writer’s room driven industry. His 2013 creation, The Crazy Ones, managed to lure Robin Williams back to a small screen series for the first time since Mork and Mindy,” according to Industrial Scripts. David also helped write the hit TV series, Big Little Lies.</p><h2 id=seth-macfarlane---net-worth-300-million><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Seth Macfarlane - Net Worth: $300 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Seth Macfarlane is in second place with a net worth of $300 million and is one of the most famous writers on this list. Not only is he a writer, he’s also an actor and director. According to Industrial Scripts, “Seth works primarily in the Comedy genre, but he has done work across the board. And in 2008, he was handed a $100m, 5-year deal by Fox for his hugely successful trio of comedy shows: Family Guy, American Dad, and The Cleveland Show. Not all of that’s for the writing, but Seth still stands as one very highly paid TV writer ever. Ted received a $500m take on a $50m budget, whilst Ted 2 also went on to gain great financial success.”</p><h2 id=chuck-lorre---net-worth-600-million><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Chuck Lorre - Net Worth: $600 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Chuck Lorre is in first place with a huge net worth of $600 million. He earned his net worth by writing hit TV shows. “Chuck Lorre has produced, written, and/or directed for such hit shows as Grace Under Fire, The Big Bang Theory, Two and a Half Men, and Mike and Molly,” according to Celebrity Net Worth. Since his shows became so popular and aired for years, he was able to earn millions of dollars from them and is one of the richest screenwriters in Hollywood.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>10 Major Celebrities Who Started As Writers On 'SNL'</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirqKhdp7aktMSsq2ark6eyprrWq6CtnaKoeqq6jKGmpaSprLywsIyrmKejlZl6o8WMp5ytZaekv7W0jg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftop-richest-screenwriters-in-hollywood-ranked-by-net-worth.html&text=The%2010%20Richest%20Screenwriters%20In%20Hollywood%2c%20Ranked%20By%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftop-richest-screenwriters-in-hollywood-ranked-by-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftop-richest-screenwriters-in-hollywood-ranked-by-net-worth.html&title=The%2010%20Richest%20Screenwriters%20In%20Hollywood%2c%20Ranked%20By%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftop-richest-screenwriters-in-hollywood-ranked-by-net-worth.html&title=The%2010%20Richest%20Screenwriters%20In%20Hollywood%2c%20Ranked%20By%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftop-richest-screenwriters-in-hollywood-ranked-by-net-worth.html&title=The%2010%20Richest%20Screenwriters%20In%20Hollywood%2c%20Ranked%20By%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftop-richest-screenwriters-in-hollywood-ranked-by-net-worth.html&description=The%2010%20Richest%20Screenwriters%20In%20Hollywood%2c%20Ranked%20By%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./times-celebs-did-commercials-or-made-comments-so-controversial-someone-had-to-apologize.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="8 Times Celebrity Spokespeople Made Commercials Or Comments So Controversial Someone Had To Apologiz">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./raymond-seville-jr-obituary.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Raymond Seville Jr Obituary: Dies in Tree Stand Fire Incident in Pennsylvania">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
