His other significant films include ‘Pleasantville’, ‘The Cider House Rules,’ ‘Wonder Boys’, and ‘The Great Gatsby’.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tobey Maguire Net Worth</h2><p>The American famous actor and film producer, Tobey Maguire has a net worth of $75 million. Maguire is probably best regarded for playing as a Spider-Man in three blockbuster films starting in 2002.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vizaca.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Tobey-Maguire-Net-Value.jpg><p>The three Spiderman films from director Sam Raimi were a predecessor to the current trend towards blockbuster films based on superhero comic book characters. The first Spider-Man film alone had a box office take of more than $820 million, while Spider-Man 2 took in $784 million, and Spider-Man 3 grossed the most of the series with $890 million.</p><p>The success of Spider Man made Tobey one of the highest-paid actors in the world in the 2000s, with single movie earnings routinely topping $15 million. Since then, Maguire has done mainly more small movies, and these three films contain the bulk of his box office take as a leading man.</p><p><strong>Note: To get the latest update about Tobey Maguire net worth, Stay connected with us!</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tobey Maguire Salary Highlights</h2><p>As you might predict, Tobey’s biggest big-screen paydays have come from playing Spider-Man. In 2002 he accumulated a respectable $4 million to play the superhero. Still, he made extensively more for the sequels – in Spider-Man 2, he dealt a salary of $17.5 million, plus five percent of the film’s box office gross. Then for the final installment, Spider-Man 3, he got the little smaller salary of $15 million but with an even larger piece of the backend, at 7.5 percent. One other payday in the Spiderman range was the $12.5 million he made for Seabiscuit.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Real Estate</h2><p>In 2019 Tobey Maguire reportedly spent $6.9 million for the 3,526-square-foot mansion in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Brentwood. In the years earlier, he made other celebrity <a href=#>real estate</a> headlines too, listing a vacant lot in Brentwood in 2018 and selling a small compound in Santa Monica to “Million Dollar Decorator” Kathy Ireland for $3.325 million in the early part of 2017. And the year before that, he was notified to have bought yet another Brentwood property “on spec” for $13 million.</p><p>In October 2020, Tobey listed a home in West Hollywood, California, for $4.2 million. He paid $3.4 million for the house two years earlier.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Early Life of Tobey Maguire</h2><p>Tobey Maguire was born in Santa Monica, California, on June 27th, 1975. His introduction to the industry came early. Maybe it is because of his mother, Wendy, who served film industry as a screenwriter and movie producer.</p><p>Still, Maguire has said that in his childhood, his earliest dream was to be a professional chef; he was inspired by his father as his father Vincent worked as a cook.</p><p>But in sixth grade, when he expressed a desire to enlist in a home economics class, his mother paid him $100 to enroll in drama, expecting him to follow in her own footsteps instead.</p><p>To say the least, a hundred bucks paid off since Maguire pursued acting even after he dropped out of high school and went on to his notable successes in the field.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Career of Tobey Maguire</h2><p>Maguire started as a TV actor in bit-part roles in series like ‘Roseanne’ and ‘Blossom’; however, his first appearance in a film was in a non-speaking minor role in the movie ‘The Wizard’ in 1989.&nbsp;</p><p>In 1995, Tobey Maguire was cast in a prominent role in the film ‘Empire Records,’ but due to his issues with alcoholism, he halfway pulled out of the film.&nbsp;</p><p>He got the most significant break in his career in the year 2002 when he was cast in the role of Spider-Man in the eponymous movie. The movie was hugely successful and led to two sequels – ‘Spider-Man 2’ and ‘Spider-Man 3 in 2004 and 2007.&nbsp;</p><p>Tobey Maguire then went on to star in the 2009 film ‘Brothers’ which also featured Jake Gyllenhaal, and his performance as a prisoner of war earned him rave reviews.</p><p>In 2013, he starred in Baz Luhrmann’s ‘The Great Gatsby’ alongside Leonardo di Caprio and followed it up with ‘Pawn Sacrifice’, in 2014, he played the role of chess legend Bobby Fischer.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Personal Life of Tobey Maguire</h2><p>In 2003 Maguire met jewelry designer Jennifer Meyer on the set of Seabiscuit. They got married in 2007, parted after almost a decade of marriage. The couple has two children, one son, and one daughter.</p><p>The other significant development of Maguire’s personal life happened in 2004, when he found a knack for tournament poker, becoming a protege of professional player Daniel Negreanu and winning <a href=#>money</a> at several occasions, even contesting in televised World Series of Poker championships as well as the notorious high-stakes games organized by Molly Bloom in the mid-2000s.</p><p>If you have watched the fictionalized film version of these games in the 2017 film Molly’s Game.</p><p>In that case, you might be aware with some of <a href=#>Maguire’s</a> behavior during these games since the character played by Michael Cera is reportedly based in part on him among other well-known regular players of Bloom’s games.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunDAzpucsmWdlrS2tdGeZKedpGLEsL7ToWY%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftobey-maguire-net-worth.html&text=Tobey%20Maguire%20Net%20Worth%3a%20The%20Richest%20Spiderman&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftobey-maguire-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftobey-maguire-net-worth.html&title=Tobey%20Maguire%20Net%20Worth%3a%20The%20Richest%20Spiderman" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftobey-maguire-net-worth.html&title=Tobey%20Maguire%20Net%20Worth%3a%20The%20Richest%20Spiderman" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftobey-maguire-net-worth.html&title=Tobey%20Maguire%20Net%20Worth%3a%20The%20Richest%20Spiderman" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftobey-maguire-net-worth.html&description=Tobey%20Maguire%20Net%20Worth%3a%20The%20Richest%20Spiderman" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./what-nathan-schwandt-has-been-up-to-since-his-breakup-with-jeffree-star.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Nathan Schwandt Has Been Up To Since His Breakup With Jeffree Star">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-10-highest-grossing-star-wars-films-ranked.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The 10 Highest-Grossing Star Wars Films, Ranked">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
