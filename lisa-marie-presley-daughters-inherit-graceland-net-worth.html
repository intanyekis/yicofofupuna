While it is unclear how much Lisa Marie's outstanding debts were at the time of her death, the lawsuits and financial troubles suggest that her estate may not be as financially stable as it once was.</p><p>In fact, <a href=#>Lisa Marie's net worth at the time of her death was -$10 million</a>. This is because of the case of mismanaged assets, unpaid taxes, and a series of legal battles she was embroiled in before her death.
