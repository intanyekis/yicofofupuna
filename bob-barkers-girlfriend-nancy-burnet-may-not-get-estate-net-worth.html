Aside from the numerous accolades, the now-deceased host was also making quite a killing as a game show host; <a href=#>taking home a staggering $10 million per year</a> by the time <a href=#>his reign on The Price is Right came to an end</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the time of his death, Barker was an extremely wealthy man, ranking among the wealthiest game show hosts of all time. As the final chapter of his life unfolds, all eyes are on Nancy Burnett, Barker’s longtime girlfriend, closest companion, and presumably, heir to his massive estate. So, what provisions did Barker make in his will, and what share of his colossal wealth will find its way to his longtime girlfriend, Nancy Burnet?</p><h2 id=just-how-much-was-bob-barker-worth-before-his-passing>Just How Much Was Bob Barker Worth Before His Passing?</h2><p>Recently deceased host Bob Barker and CBS' long-running show The Price is Right are pretty much inextricable. For a long time, the late MC was the heart and soul of the show, dedicating practically his entire life to it. After spearheading its revival in the late 1970s, Barker went on to host the show for practically half a century, a commendable achievement given the transient nature of TV shows.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bob-barker.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the show's core concept remained unaltered since the 70s, fans just couldn’t get enough of Barker’s relatable persona and delightful grandpa vibes; a triumph that didn't escape the notice of CBS higher-ups. By the time the legendary host retired in 2007, he was pocketing a staggering $10 million from the show annually; making him one of the wealthiest game show hosts in history.</p><p>As of the time of his passing, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Barker was worth a staggering $70 million</a>. With an almost half-century reign on The Price is Right, the now-deceased MC’s net worth could’ve been higher.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Drew Carey Somehow Kept His Composure After Getting Dropped On The Floor By A Price Is Right Contestant</a></span></p><p>However, as is common knowledge, the revered host was quite the philanthropist, with a significant chunk of his earnings finding purpose in backing animal charities across the world. According to Celebrity Net Worth, Barker had donated a staggering $30 million to various animal charities around the world by the time of his passing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-will-inherit-bob-barker-rsquo-s-humongous-estate>Who Will Inherit Bob Barker’s Humongous Estate?</h2><p>As the final curtain descends on Barker’s life, speculation looms regarding the fate of his massive estate. Famous for ending episodes of The Price is Right with The Phrase, "This is Bob Barker, reminding you: Help control the pet population. Have your pet spayed or neutered," Barker spent a lot of time and resources championing for animal rights. As it turns out, a bulk of the revered host’s fortune will go to ensuring that his legacy of animal activism lives on after his death.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/instar48403293-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ reports that Barker's will includes provisions for more than 40 animal rights groups and military nonprofits</a>. Among the beneficiaries is DonkeyLand Rescue, a haven for rescued donkeys nestled in Riverside, California, and the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, a marine conservation nonprofit headquartered in Friday Harbor, Washington.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Bob Barker Had A Strict Rule Drew Carey Needed To Follow Before Taking Over The Price Is Right</a></span></p><p>Aside from making provisions in his will, Barker had also made several hefty donations to these charities in his lifetime. The esteemed host generously bestowed almost 500 acres of land to DonkeyLand Rescue back in 2018. Additionally, he donated a whopping $5 million to the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society to pay for an anti-whaling vessel.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/bob-barker-s-partner-revealed-health-care-professionals-are-stunned-by-how-little-medication-the-former-host-takes.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“He was a treasure on earth and a compassionate legend in the animal kingdom helping animals all over the world,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DonkeyLand said of Barker's philanthropic ventures in a Facebook tribute</a>.</p><p>“We are very grateful to Bob Barker and Nancy Burnet [Barker’s longtime girlfriend] for helping DonkeyLand in a tremendous way through dedicated grants and donations to help us provide a rescue center for the sick, injured, and orphans in our care, as well as a sanctuary and wildlife preserve.”</p><h2 id=how-much-of-bob-barker-rsquo-s-net-worth-will-his-longtime-girlfriend-nancy-burnet-inherit>How Much Of Bob Barker’s Net Worth Will His Longtime Girlfriend Nancy Burnet Inherit?</h2><p>Before his passing, Bob Barker was in a relationship with Nancy Burnet, an animal rights activist 20 years his junior. Though the twosome remained devoted to each other for over four decades, they never tied the knot or moved in together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Neither of us had any desire ever to be married again, and he believed it when we first started seeing each other,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Burnet told People in a recent interview</a>. “But as the years went by, he proposed to me many times. I just said, ‘I just don’t want to be married.’ Our humor was very dry. We kidded in a way. And he said, ‘Not even to me?’ And I said, ‘Especially not to you.'”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/your-paragraph-text-85.png><p>Given their longstanding bond, fans must wonder; just how much of Barker's estate will Burnet inherit? Well, according to TMZ, Barker appointed Burnet as a co-executor of his will, entrusting her with the task of distributing his substantial wealth among his preferred charitable causes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Additionally, the esteemed MC willed a notable portion of his assets to the United Activists for Animal Rights charity, an organization led by Burnet. However, since the specifics of the renowned game show host's will remain private, the exact amounts he bestowed on her will remain a mystery.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Bob Barker's Partner Revealed Health Care Professionals Are Stunned By How Little Medication The Former Host Takes</a></span>While she might not be inheriting the entirety of Barker's substantial estate, there’s a high likelihood that Burnet is content knowing that the funds will be utilized to fulfill the renowned host’s life’s purpose.</p><p>"The thing I think he'd like to be remembered for most of all would be his work for animals," she shared with People. "He changed America and maybe some other countries. He educated people and raised their awareness so that they started asking questions.
