It has been an incredible journey, but together, we’ve decided to turn the page and move on from our marriage. As we enter into this next chapter, our children and relationship as co-parents and dear friends will remain our priority.

I am shocked, heartbroken, and devastated. Heartbreak aside, I am listening and will continue to listen and educate myself on these delicate matters. I didn’t realize how much I didn’t know.

Thank you for all of the love and support, and thank you in advance for your continued kindness, respect, and consideration for our children and me as we find ways to move forward."</p><p>It is unclear whether Elizabeth Chambers was aware of the allegations prior to when they became public — and whether they might be the reason the couple split up half a year earlier.</p><h2 id=why-did-elizabeth-chambers-file-for-divorce>Why Did Elizabeth Chambers File For Divorce?</h2><p>According to Vanity Fair, Elizabeth Chambers decided to end things with Hammer after <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she received a raunchy text message from him</a> — one that was not meant for her. "The Hammers had been in expensive family therapy, but, to Elizabeth, the indiscretions — and more notably his decision to flee the family during a global pandemic — were the final straw," the source claimed. "When Armie touched down in the U.S., he mistakenly sent a raunchy text message meant for someone else to his estranged spouse. Elizabeth filed for divorce shortly after."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Reportedly, Chambers was aware of Hammer's infidelity as the actor confesses to cheating in 2017 shortly after his son's birth.
