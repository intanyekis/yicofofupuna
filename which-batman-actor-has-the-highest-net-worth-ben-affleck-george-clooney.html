Whether it is with their incredible comics, television shows, or their movies, DC has always had a way of roping in audiences to enjoy their biggest and best characters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Batman</a> is DC's most popular character not named <a href=#>Superman</a>, and the Dark Knight has generated the comics giant billions through the years. There have been quite a few actors who have played the character on the big and small screen, and many of them have made bank with their acting.</p><p>So, which Batman actor is the wealthiest of them all? Let's take a look and find out.</p><h2 id=many-great-actors-have-played-batman>Many Great Actors Have Played Batman</h2><p>As one of the greatest superheroes ever created, Batman is someone that has inspired legions of fans and who has proven to be a bankable commodity in entertainment. After becoming a red-hot character in the pages, DC wisely took him to both the big and small screen, and they've been cashing in for decades now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There have been some tremendously talented individuals who have had the chance to play the character over the years in film and on television. The cool thing about this is that every fan has their favorite version of the character. Some people still love Michael Keaton's take on Batman from the 80s and 90s, while others immediately think of the great Kevin Conroy and his work on Batman: The Animated Series and the Arkham games.</p><p>The character himself is known for having an unthinkable amount of wealth, and it just so happens that many actors who have played Batman over the years have earned themselves a pretty penny while working in entertainment.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Twitter Thinks Robert Pattinson Just Confirmed A Sex Scene With Zoë Kravitz In 'The Batman'</a></span></p><h2 id=ben-affleck-is-worth-150-million>Ben Affleck Is Worth $150 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Here at the number two spot is none other than Ben Affleck, who has been playing Batman in the modern DCEU. Affleck's casting was met with some skepticism, but he wound up delivering the goods when given some decent material to work with. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a> shows that Affleck is currently worth $150 million.</p><p>To date, Affleck has played the Caped Crusader three times, notably in Batman v Superman and Justice League on the big screen. He was set to write and direct his own Batman movie, but after things fell through, Matt Reeves stepped in and cast Robert Pattinson as the new Batman over at DC. Only time will tell if that upcoming film will tie into what Affleck has been doing in the DCEU.</p><p>Affleck has certainly had an interesting time playing the character, though many feel it is due to the material he has had to work with. Nevertheless, it has been announced that he will be appearing in 2022's The Flash, which could reset the DCEU, allowing for the franchise to get a fresh start.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's amazing to see that Affleck has amassed such an impressive amount of wealth, but he falls well short of the Batman actor that tops the list.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Think The DCEU's Controversial Batman Arc Is Actually Great</a></span></p><h2 id=george-clooney-is-worth-500-million>George Clooney Is Worth $500 Million</h2><p>Coming in at the top spot in this contest of net worths is George Clooney, who played the Caped Crusader in Batman & Robin, which is largely regarded as one of the worst movies in the Dark Knight's history. Celebrity Net Worth shows that Clooney is worth a whopping <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$500 million</a>.</p><p>Clooney took over for Val Kilmer as the 90s were coming to an end, and he lasted as the hero for just one film. Unfortunately, the film buried Batman on the big screen until Christopher Nolan revived the hero with Batman Begins.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Clooney has since talked about the film in various interviews. In one such interview, he said, "With hindsight it’s easy to look back at this and go, 'Woah, that was really s--- and I was really bad in it.' It was a difficult film to be good in."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Are Losing It Over Robert Pattinson’s ‘Batman’ Voice In Latest Trailer</a></span></p><p>Clooney and Affleck are tops in this contest of net worths, but other Batman actors have done quite well for themselves financially. According to Celebrity Net Worth, Christian Bale is worth $120 million, Robert Pattinson is worth $100 million, Michael Keaton is worth $40 million, and Val Kilmer is worth $25 million. None are as rich as Bruce Wayne, but we're sure that they're okay with that.</p><p>While not a prerequisite for the role, it seems that having a substantial amount of wealth can go a long way in landing the role of Batman on the big screen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>How 'Batman & Robin' Almost Stopped 'Smallville' From Getting Made</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaGTnXqjrdOmmKdlkZjBsL6MoZisZaSdsm60yKCfnqukYrumwIywpqusmGKvprqMmp2fpJWYuG6zxKipoJ1dmLmwu82esGg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhich-batman-actor-has-the-highest-net-worth-ben-affleck-george-clooney.html&text=Which%20Batman%20Actor%20Has%20The%20Highest%20Net%20Worth%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhich-batman-actor-has-the-highest-net-worth-ben-affleck-george-clooney.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhich-batman-actor-has-the-highest-net-worth-ben-affleck-george-clooney.html&title=Which%20Batman%20Actor%20Has%20The%20Highest%20Net%20Worth%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhich-batman-actor-has-the-highest-net-worth-ben-affleck-george-clooney.html&title=Which%20Batman%20Actor%20Has%20The%20Highest%20Net%20Worth%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhich-batman-actor-has-the-highest-net-worth-ben-affleck-george-clooney.html&title=Which%20Batman%20Actor%20Has%20The%20Highest%20Net%20Worth%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhich-batman-actor-has-the-highest-net-worth-ben-affleck-george-clooney.html&description=Which%20Batman%20Actor%20Has%20The%20Highest%20Net%20Worth%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./10-ultimate-toys-for-rich-girls-and-boys.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="10 Ultimate Toys For Rich Girls And Boys">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./taylor-ann-green-heard-paige-and-craig-cheating-rumors-at-bravocon.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Taylor Ann Green Heard Paige and Craig Cheating Rumors at BravoCon">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
