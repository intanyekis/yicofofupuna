One of his biggest accomplishments is becoming the youngest boxer to win a heavyweight title at 20-years old. Tyson was a brutal boxer who had a lot of strength and did some crazy things in the ring.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Tyson's boxing career came to an end, he got involved in the film industry. Some of the movies he's been in include,&nbsp;The Hangover, China Salesman&nbsp;and&nbsp;Kickboxer: Retaliation.&nbsp;Since then, he's also started his own podcast called, "Hotboxin' with Mike Tyson."</p><p>Through all that he's done, he hasn't made many of his friendships public. He's certainly not anti-social, but he doesn't necessarily promote who he's close to. With some of the crazy antics he's done in the ring, he definitely has some people who aren't a fan of him. So, who really is close to Mike Tyson?</p><h2 id=inner-circle-dana-white><span class=item-num>16 </span><span>Inner Circle: Dana White</span></h2><p>Although there have been some feuds between Mike Tyson and Dana White, they've remained pretty close. Tyson is clearly a fan of MMA, and continuously&nbsp;shows support of the sport. A video even surfaced of the two on a plane together, where Tyson then pranked White. Despite some time drama between the two, they're definitely close.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>RELATED - <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">18 FACTS ABOUT DANA WHITE HE WANTS TO KEEP ON THE DOWN LOW</a></p><h2 id=aren-t-floyd-mayweather><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Aren't: Floyd Mayweather</span></h2><p>There was a time where Mike Tyson pretend to hit Floyd Mayweather. Apparently, Mayweather didn't flinch when this happened. It's been public that Tyson <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">isn't a fan</a> of one of the richest boxers out there. Tyson has stated that he would "beat up" Mayweather if they fought each other in their primes.</p><h2 id=inner-circle-jamie-foxx><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Inner Circle: Jamie Foxx</span></h2><p>Considering Jamie Foxx is playing Mike Tyson in an upcoming film, the two have to be close together. The only way Foxx could accurately portray the famous fighter would be by learning as much as he can about him. It's safe to assume the two have been spending quite some time together lately.</p><h2 id=aren-t-teddy-atlas><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Aren't: Teddy Atlas</span></h2><p>It would be difficult to make up with someone who pulled a firearm&nbsp;on someone else. When Tyson was 15-years old, Teddy Atlas pulled a weapon&nbsp;on him. Ever since there's been constant drama between the two. Although they "made up," the two certainly haven't become good friends after a long time period of bad blood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=inner-circle-rob-hickman><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Inner Circle: Rob Hickman</span></h2><p>Tyson Ranch is a weed dispensary with different locations. The CEO of Mike Tyson's company is a businessman, Rob Hickman. Hickman is obviously someone Tyson really trusts considering they're in business together, and the two have spoken highly about each other. It's been a good relationship for the two of them.</p><h2 id=aren-t-michael-jordan><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Aren't: Michael Jordan</span></h2><p>Two of the best at their respected sports have had beef going back to 1988. There was a dinner, that led to a face-off between Jordan and Tyson. Tyson was confronting Jordan about a situation. It was over a rumored affair with Jordan and Tyson's ex-wife that had set them up on bad terms from the start.</p><h2 id=inner-circle-alex-avant><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Inner Circle: Alex Avant</span></h2><p>There have been some pictures on social media of Alex Avant and Mike Tyson that date all the way back to the late '80s. While Avant isn't some big-name celebrity, Tyson does post with him quite a bit. This seems like one of those friendships that are lowkey, but also extremely meaningful.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=aren-t-johne-horne><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Aren't: Johne Horne</span></h2><p>One of the most famous interviews in sports history comes after a Mike Tyson fight, where Tyson bit off another boxer's ear. After it happened, John Horne gave a powerful speech defending Tyson and showing how irrelevant his ear was in the fight. Tyson later fired Horne, and there was a slight feud between the two following the firing. Horne has been in the shadows ever since.</p><h2 id=inner-circle-kevin-bell><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Inner Circle: Kevin Bell</span></h2><p>Another one of Mike Tyson's most trusted peers is Kevin Bell. Bell is the Chief Operating Officer of Tyson Ranch. Bell has been in a lot of pictures with Tyson when the two are in business meetings or doing anything for Tyson Ranch. Although there's not much to be known about Bell, he plays a big part in Tyson's company.</p><h2 id=aren-t-manny-pacquiao><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Aren't: Manny Pacquiao</span></h2><p>If Manny Pacquaio and Mike Tyson were close, they would probably be training together. According to Bleacher Report, Tyson <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tried getting a job</a> in Pacquaio's training facility. Clearly, it didn't work out, so you begin to wonder what happened behind closed doors. There hasn't been drama between the two boxers, but they don't appear to be close either.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>RELATED - <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">14 THINGS ABOUT MANNY PACQUIAO FANS CHOOSE TO IGNORE</a></p><h2 id=inner-circle-serena-williams><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Inner Circle: Serena Williams</span></h2><p>Talk about a good duo together. As of recent, Mike Tyson has been training Serena Williams. Although Tyson isn't boxing anymore, he's still in incredible shape and did a great job speeding up his agility and becoming more durable. As Williams continues to age, this is actually a great pair up for her to continue to get stronger.</p><h2 id=aren-t-monica-turner><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Aren't: Monica Turner</span></h2><p>Clearly, Mike Tyson and his ex-wife Monica Turner are no longer close. After four years of being married, the two got a divorce. Turner claimed that the professional boxer cheated on her. While the two had been together through a lot of different things, their marriage finally came to an end.</p><h2 id=inner-circle-lakiha-spicer><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Inner Circle: Lakiha Spicer</span></h2><p>Although there have been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">some broken relationships </a>in Mike Tyson's life, he's been going strong with his current wife, Lakiha Spicer. The two have been married since 2009, making it Tyson's longest marriage of the three. Despite all there is positive and negative about the former boxer, they've remained tight through it all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=aren-t-robin-givens><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Aren't: Robin Givens</span></h2><p>Out of Tyson's two previous marriages, his marriage with Robin Givens had the most attention around it. Tyson accused Givens of cheating on him with Brad Pitt and Michael Jordan, which led to the feud between Tyson and Jordan. It went as far as Givens going on national television and even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">humiliated</a> Tyson.</p><h2 id=inner-circle-evander-holyfield><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Inner Circle: Evander Holyfield</span></h2><p>One of the most famous moments in boxing history is when Mike Tyson bit off Evander Holyfield's ear. The filthy move made in the ring caused a feud between the two for a while. Despite the insanely gross move that Tyson made, they actually became friends later on in life. So much so that Tyson actually brought Holyfield on his podcast to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">discuss</a> the fight years later.</p><h2 id=aren-t-don-king><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Aren't: Don King</span></h2><p>Back in the glory days, Don King was a promoter during Tyson's fighting days. However, Tyson has stated how King "stiffed" him of a lot of money. The issue got really bad to the point where Tyson actually sued the former promoter for $100 million. During the Boxing Hall of Fame Induction in 2013, Tyson even tossed water at King to show the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">feud isn't over.&nbsp;</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>NEXT - <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MIKE TYSON SPILLS SECRETS ABOUT MICHAEL JACKSON</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhvZqiVpL2tsYytn5qsXZa%2FpnnIp2SmoZuaerXF0qilrGWZo7umvoycoKubnJp6eXnToZitZZGnsq%2FAjg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f8-people-that-are-in-mike-tysons-inner-circle-8-that-arent.html&text=8%20People%20That%20Are%20In%20Mike%20Tyson%27s%20Inner%20Circle%20%288%20That%20Aren%27t%29&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f8-people-that-are-in-mike-tysons-inner-circle-8-that-arent.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f8-people-that-are-in-mike-tysons-inner-circle-8-that-arent.html&title=8%20People%20That%20Are%20In%20Mike%20Tyson%27s%20Inner%20Circle%20%288%20That%20Aren%27t%29" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f8-people-that-are-in-mike-tysons-inner-circle-8-that-arent.html&title=8%20People%20That%20Are%20In%20Mike%20Tyson%27s%20Inner%20Circle%20%288%20That%20Aren%27t%29" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f8-people-that-are-in-mike-tysons-inner-circle-8-that-arent.html&title=8%20People%20That%20Are%20In%20Mike%20Tyson%27s%20Inner%20Circle%20%288%20That%20Aren%27t%29" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f8-people-that-are-in-mike-tysons-inner-circle-8-that-arent.html&description=8%20People%20That%20Are%20In%20Mike%20Tyson%27s%20Inner%20Circle%20%288%20That%20Aren%27t%29" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./alexis-texas-adult-actress-wiki-biography-age-height-weight-boyfriend-net-worth-family-career-facts.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Alexis Texas (Adult Actress) Wiki, Biography, Age, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Net Worth, Family, Car">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./15-famous-ladies-with-more-than-one-baby-daddy.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="15 Famous Ladies With More Than One Baby Daddy">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
