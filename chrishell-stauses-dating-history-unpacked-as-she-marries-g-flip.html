Stause's famed credit also includes her playing the role of <i>Amanda Dillon</i> on <i>All My Children </i>and Jordan Ridgeway on <i>Days of Our Lives.</i> &nbsp;</p><p>Born on July 21, 1981, in Draffenville, Kentucky, Stause garnered solid success on the small screen. Chrishell later branched her career into the real estate business before returning to the spotlight with <i>Selling Sunset.</i> Chrishell's personal life has since overshadowed her professional ventures. &nbsp;</p><h3>Chrishell Stause is Married to G Flip! &nbsp;&nbsp;</h3><p>Chrishell Stause's relationship with Australian musician <strong>G Flip</strong>, real name <strong>Georgia Claire Flipo</strong>, was a shocker. The <i>Selling Sunset </i>fame is now happily married to G Flip after over a year of dating bliss.&nbsp;</p><p>In a sweet surprise, the actress posted a reel on Instagram that captured some of the most beautiful moments from their wedding. &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/5/11/328366358_560542112790321_2005359333529444311_n%20(1)%20(1)-1683822025977.jpg><p>"Love doesn't always go as planned… Sometimes it's immeasurably better," Stause wrote in the caption.</p><p>Chrishell also gave a shout-out to Flip's new song, <i>I'll Be Your Man,</i> which is a tribute to the duo's surprising love story. Stause and her musician wife were in committed relationships with their then-partners when they met in 2021 Halloween.</p><h2>Chrishell Stause Married the First Woman She Dated!</h2><p>The 41-year-old actress Chrishell Stause had never dated a woman before and claimed she was attracted to Flip. But Chrishell didn't think much of it.&nbsp;</p><p>The <i>Selling Sunset</i> fame remained unsure of her flexible sexuality. Chrishell remained uncertain even after she and Flip shared their first kiss. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/5/11/338602626_648337960375544_7079910754309016882_n%20(1)%20(1)-1683822031752.jpg><p><strong>&nbsp;The duo started dating early last year.&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>Photo Source: Instagram</strong></p><p>Chrishell recalls how they shared that moment after she got stood up at a party in February 2022. While Stause still couldn't figure out her feelings for the Australian singer, Flip, who identifies as non-binary and uses pronouns they/them, liked Stause. &nbsp;</p><p>Things escalated fast after Chrishell was asked to star in Flip's mv,<i> Get Me Outta Here</i>, where the pair were seen getting steamy throughout the song.</p><h3>Chrishell's Perspective Changed After Meeting Flim!</h3><p>Chrishell's unprecedented feelings towards the musician almost seemed meant to be at one point, and she broke the surprising news in May 2022. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/5/11/328143771_2793258177471844_6303745333182691976_n%20(1)%20(1)-1683822038427.jpg><p>During the reunion episode of <i>Selling Sunset, </i>the <i>Days Of Our Lives </i>alum got candid about her budding romance with G.</p><p>&nbsp;"I recently have been spending a lot of time with someone that's very important to me," Stause said as she went on to reveal the exciting news. &nbsp;</p><p>The actress-turned-real estate agent has since dished on her romance and sexuality several times. Stause says her relationship with Flip changed her outlook on love and sexuality.</p><p>"It opened my brain up to the fact that I'm attracted to energy," <a href=#>said</a> the actress. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Stause's new wife, musician G Flip, is thirteen years younger than her!&nbsp;</strong></p><figure class=media></figure><p>Stause's wife, G Flip, 28, is an Australian singer, songwriter, drummer, and producer. Flip has released a slew of hits since kicking off their career in 2018. Some of their top-rated songs are<i> About You, I Am Not Afraid, Drink Too Much,</i> and <i>Lover.</i> &nbsp;</p><h3>Inside Chrishell Stause's Dating History! &nbsp;&nbsp;</h3><p>Chrishell has been churning out exciting dating headlines since her early days in Hollywood. The soap opera star was still working her way up when she was linked with fellow actor <strong>Matthew Morrison.</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/5/11/317374549_516076117202396_508280960304169910_n%20(1)%20(1)-1683822045223.jpg><p>The pair eventually confirmed their romance and engaged in 2006- only to call off the wedding a year later. Morrison later revealed that he didn't mean to propose to Stause but felt pressured after a year of dating. Things seemingly didn't end on a good note. Chrishell bluntly called out her ex-fiancee in 2019. &nbsp;</p><p>After her failed engagement with Matthew, Chrishell rekindled her romance with an old flame, <strong>Graham Bunn</strong>.<strong> </strong>Stause and Bunn dated on and off during her 20s. Stause started dating actor <strong>Justin Hartley</strong> in 2013 and got engaged to the Emmy-nominated actor in 2016. &nbsp;</p><p>The couple <a href=#>walked down the aisle</a> after a year of engagement in October 2017. The twosome's intimate wedding, which had no more than 74 guests, was a dream come true for Chrishell. Hartley's daughter,<strong> Isabella,</strong> from his first marriage, served as the flower girl. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Stause said, "It&nbsp;exceeded anything I could have ever imagined."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/5/11/311706619_1037255617118653_1138420736742197794_n%20(1)%20(1)-1683822052360.jpg><p>But Stause's marital bliss lasted only a couple of years. The <i>Selling Sunsets </i>viewers watched their favorite couple walk down the unraveling road as Justin <a href=#>filed for divorce</a> in November 2019.</p><p>Citing "irreconcilable differences" as the reason behind their split, Hartley revealed that they had separated months ago. Life went on Chrishell as she started dating <i>Dancing with the Stars</i> pro-<strong>Keo Motsepe.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Hurtley, on the other hand, got married for the <a href=#>third time-</a> to actress <strong>Sofia Pernas</strong>. Justin and Sofia tied the knot a month after his divorce from Stause was finalized in February 2022. &nbsp;</p><p>Chrishell's last high-profile romance, before she delved into a romantic and eye-opening journey with G Flip, was with her boss, and <i>Selling Sunset</i> co-star, <strong>Jason Oppenheim.</strong> The duo's romance fizzled out in months as both Stause and Jason wanted different things from their relationship. &nbsp;</p><p>Stay connected to <a href=#>Married Celeb</a> for more.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jpyfq6GjnbKtuIysq5qto5rAbrDAraCnn12dtrTAzquwZq2epa6kt8SdZJqrXai1pnnMmqmroZWoeqh5xaWgqQ%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fchrishell-stauses-dating-history-unpacked-as-she-marries-g-flip.html&text=Inside%20Her%20Marriage%20to%20G%20Flip%20and%20Dating%20History&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fchrishell-stauses-dating-history-unpacked-as-she-marries-g-flip.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fchrishell-stauses-dating-history-unpacked-as-she-marries-g-flip.html&title=Inside%20Her%20Marriage%20to%20G%20Flip%20and%20Dating%20History" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fchrishell-stauses-dating-history-unpacked-as-she-marries-g-flip.html&title=Inside%20Her%20Marriage%20to%20G%20Flip%20and%20Dating%20History" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fchrishell-stauses-dating-history-unpacked-as-she-marries-g-flip.html&title=Inside%20Her%20Marriage%20to%20G%20Flip%20and%20Dating%20History" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fchrishell-stauses-dating-history-unpacked-as-she-marries-g-flip.html&description=Inside%20Her%20Marriage%20to%20G%20Flip%20and%20Dating%20History" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./patrick-j-adams-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Patrick J.
