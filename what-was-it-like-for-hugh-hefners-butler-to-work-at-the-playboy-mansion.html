A&E's docuseries, Secrets of Playboy particularly talks about the magazine's legacy in the #MeToo era. Partly based on the memoir The Dark Secrets of Playboy by Hef's butler Stefan Tetenbaum, the late industry giant is now under scrutiny for alleged rape and abuse of power. A number of loyalists, including<a href=#> Hef's son, Cooper Hefner continued to defend his "unconventional" lifestyle</a>. But to many viewers, people should be paying attention to Tetenbaum's "hair-raising stories." Here's everything he's revealed about Hef's world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Hugh Hefner Desperately Wanted Britney Spears For 'Playboy' But Why Did She Say No?</a></span></p><h2 id=hugh-hefner-39-s-butler-exposed-playboy-39-s-39-world-of-power-and-abusive-manipulation-39>Hugh Hefner's Butler Exposed Playboy's 'World Of Power and Abusive Manipulation'</h2><p>Tetenbaum wrote his book almost 40 years ago, but at the time, "Hefner had tremendous power to stop anyone looking to tell this story," he said. "My story at the Playboy Mansion West during the peak years [of] 1978-80s was an extraordinary period of Playboy Enterprises' power and fame," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the author said in an exclusive statement to Variety</a>. "Working alongside Hefner gave me incredible insight into the daily life and times of such a complex man and the world he created. It was his world — private and hidden."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He added that the book talks about "the dark underbelly of the treatment of his girlfriend and the other women who wanted to be part of the Playboy world professionally and behind the bedroom doors. Only these people who lived there knew the truth of what was expected from them. I was not able to publish this book until now because the publishing world could not take a risk with such a giant figure in the media world. Hefner had tremendous power to stop anyone looking to tell this story."</p><p>He also acknowledged that some people might not believe his claims. "No one could believe these hair-raising stories then and a certain group of loyalists to Hefner still can't believe that this world of power and abusive manipulation was true," he continued. "This book is finally able to be believed because almost all the chapters have unfolded during the last few years. This is a time that the #MeToo movement and Time's Up era have opened the eyes of many to believe my story in 2022."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Jayne Mansfield's Playboy Centerfold May Have Destroyed Her Life</a></span></p><h2 id=what-hugh-hefner-39-s-exes-have-said-about-life-in-the-playboy-mansion>What Hugh Hefner's Exes Have Said About Life In The Playboy Mansion</h2><p>After seven years of being Hef's number one girlfriend, Holly Madison left the Playboy Mansion in 2008. Recently, <a href=#>she described living with the late publisher as "very cult-like."</a> She even said that she pretended to think everything in there was great. "I started to feel like I was in love with him in a very like, looking back on it, I feel like it was a very Stockholm syndrome type of thing," she said of her "main girlfriend" position. "I just felt like I identified with him and he was complimenting me so much in the beginning, and I just started to, in my mind, blame all the other problems on the other women. Like, 'Oh, this is a miserable situation, but if these other women weren't here, it wouldn't be like that."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She also revealed that Hef's live-in girlfriends followed a strict 9 PM curfew. "I'd almost like locked myself into this box, in a way, which wasn't hard to do there, because it's a very cult-like atmosphere, anyway, and you're manipulated to feel that way," she said of the mansion's "strict code of conduct" that got even more "toxic" later on. "My own kind of shame kept me there, too," she continued. "I couldn't really imagine a life outside of there. Like I thought, 'Okay, this is my last stop. If I want to have kids, I'm going to try.' And then when I knew that wasn't going to be a possibility with him, like we tried in vitro and everything. It didn't work. I was like, 'Okay, well, if I'm not going to have kids here, that's something I need to think about. This is really like a death sentence, in a way.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kendra Wilkinson also said that she felt trapped inside the mansion when she was dating Hefner. "Nights were hard because while my Playmate friends got to go out and party, I would have to be home by 9 p.m," she recalled. "I'd get a text message from a girl that read, 'Having so much fun in Vegas. Wish you were here! Partying with all these football players,' and that was devastating. I felt so trapped and angry when I was missing out on something good."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Hugh Hefner Deserves More Credit For The Impact He Made Outside Of Playboy</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=hugh-hefner-39-s-son-on-growing-up-in-the-playboy-mansion>Hugh Hefner's Son On Growing Up In The Playboy Mansion</h2><p>Hef's son, Cooper Hefner has fond memories of the Playboy Mansion. "This really acted as a pretty traditional home - even though it's not a traditional home - for me and my brother, especially when our parents were together," said the U.S. Air Force reservist. "When my mom and dad separated and he bought the mansion next door, he broke down the wall and my brother and I went back and forth between both properties."</p><p>He also clarified that he didn't live his dad's crazy lifestyle and that his upbringing was pretty normal. "It's funny because it's such an iconic place and obviously the whole world probably sees it as one thing which is this mecca for or****," he said, "but the reality is, is for me, it has always represented a sort of Indiana Jones adventure. Because when I was a kid, there was none of that going on and I was swimming around here and that's what it was to me."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>This Is Why Donald Trump Jr. 'Hated' Visiting The Playboy Mansion</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYsSiv4yiq2akmaCybrLOq2ShrZedeqmxxaecq6tdl8K1uMSrZK2nXay8s7eMmqtmrJiaerG4wLKZqLFdoq6vv8iopWg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-was-it-like-for-hugh-hefners-butler-to-work-at-the-playboy-mansion.html&text=What%20Was%20It%20Like%20For%20Hugh%20Hefner%27s%20Butler%20To%20Work%20At%20The%20%27Playboy%20Mansion%27%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-was-it-like-for-hugh-hefners-butler-to-work-at-the-playboy-mansion.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-was-it-like-for-hugh-hefners-butler-to-work-at-the-playboy-mansion.html&title=What%20Was%20It%20Like%20For%20Hugh%20Hefner%27s%20Butler%20To%20Work%20At%20The%20%27Playboy%20Mansion%27%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-was-it-like-for-hugh-hefners-butler-to-work-at-the-playboy-mansion.html&title=What%20Was%20It%20Like%20For%20Hugh%20Hefner%27s%20Butler%20To%20Work%20At%20The%20%27Playboy%20Mansion%27%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-was-it-like-for-hugh-hefners-butler-to-work-at-the-playboy-mansion.html&title=What%20Was%20It%20Like%20For%20Hugh%20Hefner%27s%20Butler%20To%20Work%20At%20The%20%27Playboy%20Mansion%27%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-was-it-like-for-hugh-hefners-butler-to-work-at-the-playboy-mansion.html&description=What%20Was%20It%20Like%20For%20Hugh%20Hefner%27s%20Butler%20To%20Work%20At%20The%20%27Playboy%20Mansion%27%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./24years-content-creator-priya-das-uncensored-video-gone-viral-viral-video.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="24years, Content Creator Priya Das uncensored Video gone Viral  Viral Video The Talks Today">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./uma-thurman-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Uma Thurman Net Worth | TheRichest">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
