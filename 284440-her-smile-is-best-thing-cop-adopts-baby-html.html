He <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/human-interest/jesse-whitten-adopt-homeless-baby-felt-right/>told</a> PEOPLE:</p><p class=Zg>“She was very honest about her situation, how she was struggling with drug addiction and what was going on in her life."</p><p class=Zg>Jesse often checked up on her as a benevolent man and offered to take her to a shelter.

Because she was homeless and the baby had drugs in her system, the county asked her if she wished to arrange for emergency placement in foster care.</p><p class=Zg>Instead, she told them to call Officer Jesse.
