While he has not shared any detail about his transformation, we believe he focused on diet and exercise to lose weight.</strong></p><p>Gold Rush is a reality television series that follows a group of motivated miners and their family-run mining firms as they strive to mine a fortune in gold across North and South America. The show began with Alaskan miners and later proceeded to the Klondike area of Yukon, Canada.</p><p><strong>Freddy Dodge</strong>, a popular cast member, appeared in season 1 as a member of Jack and Todd Hoffman's team. He is a gold recovery specialist who understands exactly how and where to find the motherlode and acquire the greatest nuggets when mining.</p><p>In January 2021, the <a href=#><strong>TV star</strong></a> put all of his experience and knowledge to good use by launching a new spin-off program called Gold Rush: Freddy Dodge's Mine Rescue, in which he helps struggling mining companies and helps them earn their fortune. Season 3 of the spin-off, Gold Rush: Mine Rescue with Freddy & Juan, is currently streaming and 3 episodes have been released so far.</p><p>On the other hand, many people have observed that Freddy Dodge has shed a few pounds. He looks comparatively leaner. As a result, viewers want to know the reason behind his weight loss. Well, we've got you covered.</p><p>Previously, we checked on the <a href=#><strong>weight loss</strong></a> stories of <a href=#><strong>NBA Dennis Rodman</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Nischelle Turner</strong></a>.</p><h2>Weight Loss: Freddy Dodge Looks Much Better and Healthier in His Recent Appearance!</h2><p>Comparing his before and after pictures, there is no doubt that <strong>Freddy Dodge</strong>'s appearance has changed significantly because of his weight loss. However, the Gold Rush star has not given any statement regarding who and how he lost.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/houseandwhips.com/storage/2023/07/freddy-dodge-after-weight-loss.jpg alt="Freddy Dodge after weight loss. houseandwhips.com" width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Freddy Dodge after weight loss.</strong><br><strong>Image Source: GH Gossip</strong></p><p>Considering he is already in his mid-50s, we can assume Freddy has been losing weight for the sake of his health. You need to take care of your body shape as you age. Your body can experience fatal consequences if you don't take care of your body, especially if you're approaching your 60s. Previously, some Reddit users also discussed the same thing because of his overweight. One person <a href=# rel=noopener>wrote</a>,</p><p><strong>Does Freddy seem to look a little unhealthy? I know he has put on a little weight over the years but watching Mine Rescue this season he just looks like he is a heart attack waiting to happen. Does anyone know if something is going on with him?</strong></p><p>Similarly, another wrote,</p><p><strong>He certainly looks like he's running pretty high blood pressure. He seems like a nice dude - I hope he can lose some weight and prevent a heart attack.</strong></p><p>Freddy Dodge has definitely shed a few pounds now. His body and facial expression look way too better these days. He might have realized that everything he has done and is doing would mean nothing if he does not take care of his body.</p><p data-wp-editing=1><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/houseandwhips.com/storage/2023/07/freddy-dodge-before-weight-loss.jpg alt="Freddy Dodge before weight loss. houseandwhips.com" width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Freddy Dodge before weight loss.</strong><br><strong>Image Source: The Cinemaholic</strong></p><p>Even though he has not revealed anything, we believe Freddy might have taken care of his diet and exercise routine for his weight loss. While there's a chance he might have consumed some kind of weight loss pills or undergone surgeries to lose weight, we don't think a doctor would recommend these ways to someone of Freddy's age.</p><p>We shall find the truth if Freddy Dodge decides to open up about his weight loss secret someday since all of the above information is solely based on our assumptions. We will get back to you as soon as we get any updates.</p><h2>Calorie Deficit For Weight Loss Explained!</h2><p>You might have heard the term "<a href=# rel=noopener>calorie deficit</a>" if you've ever researched about losing weight naturally. However, a lot of people are unaware of what it actually means. Well, here is everything you need to know.</p><p>To lose weight, you must consume fewer calories than you burn. If you consume more calories than you burn, you do not have a calorie deficit and will not lose weight. You may increase your calorie deficit by adjusting what and how much you consume, as well as through exercise. For healthy weight cutting, most doctors and nutritionists recommend a combination of the two.</p><p>There is no single ideal way to decrease calories. In general, if you limit calories while maintaining a minimum quantity, you will lose weight. One tried and true way is to substitute water for all sugar-sweetened drinks. Over the course of six months, this simple alteration can result in a 2% drop in body weight.</p><p>Just keep an eye on your calorie intake. Smaller portions might also help, as can smart meal planning. A licensed dietician can help you in determining appropriate strategies to control your meals and reduce your daily calorie intake.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6rApq3Nna6hoaCoe6S7zGidq52UmcZusM6dnp5lp5q2qLTTZqOoq6Nk</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ffreddy-dodge-weight-loss.html&text=The%20Gold%20Rush%20Star%20Looks%20Healthier%21&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffreddy-dodge-weight-loss.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffreddy-dodge-weight-loss.html&title=The%20Gold%20Rush%20Star%20Looks%20Healthier%21" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ffreddy-dodge-weight-loss.html&title=The%20Gold%20Rush%20Star%20Looks%20Healthier%21" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ffreddy-dodge-weight-loss.html&title=The%20Gold%20Rush%20Star%20Looks%20Healthier%21" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffreddy-dodge-weight-loss.html&description=The%20Gold%20Rush%20Star%20Looks%20Healthier%21" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./uma-thurman-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Uma Thurman Net Worth | TheRichest">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./rapper-juicy-j-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Rapper Juicy J Net Worth  How Much Is Rapper Juicy J Worth?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
