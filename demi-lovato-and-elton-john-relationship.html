Waking up in the hospital, they said they didn't know if they'd ever step foot on the stage again. The singer made their stage return in the 2020 Grammy Awards and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shared their journey through addiction</a> in the 2021 YouTube docuseries,&nbsp;Dancing with the Devil. It featured a number of people close to them such as family, friends, and new manager, Scooter Braun.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans were also surprised to see other&nbsp;faces such as Christina Aguilera, Will Ferrell, and Elton John. John made headlines for slamming Lovato's sobriety method in the documentary. But despite that, the 74-year-old English singer has been a supportive friend to the 28-year-old Disney alum through it all. His past experience with addiction has probably helped&nbsp;the&nbsp;Met Him Last Night&nbsp;singer. The two have also shared other meaningful moments together. Here's how close they really are.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Christina Aguilera Shows Mad Love For Demi Lovato, As Her Last Documentary Episode Airs" href=#>Christina Aguilera Shows Mad Love For Demi Lovato, As Her Last Documentary Episode Airs</a></span></p><h2 id=how-demi-lovato-and-elton-john-became-friends>How Demi Lovato And Elton John Became Friends</h2><p>Elton John has always been a fan of Demi Lovato's music. In the docuseries, he said, "I first heard Demi Lovato’s music quite a while ago." He said he loved their voice. The two performed together in 2016 and grew closer since. "I asked [them] to come and duet with me on Don’t Go Breaking My Heart," John explained. He&nbsp;also expressed his&nbsp;empathy for the young performer's struggle with the pressures of stardom. "When you’re young, and you’re famous, my god, it's tough," he noted.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Bennie and the Jets singer has so much faith and admiration for Lovato. "[They're] human, and [they're] adorable, and [they're] brave," he said. He also called them "god" and "perfect." John may not be in the&nbsp;Camp Rock&nbsp;star's usual circle, but his compassion and belief in their talent and strength have certainly helped&nbsp;them get to a better place.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Fans Celebrate Their Love For Demi Lovato On The 13th Anniversary Of Disney’s ‘Camp Rock’" href=#>Fans Celebrate Their Love For Demi Lovato On The 13th Anniversary Of Disney’s ‘Camp Rock’</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=demi-lovato-performed-in-2021-iheartradio-awards-elton-john-tribute>Demi Lovato Performed In 2021 iHeartRadio Awards' Elton John Tribute</h2><p>Lovato and John's closeness was highlighted during the 2021 iHeart Radio Awards' Elton John Tribute. The&nbsp;Good Place&nbsp;singer honored the Grammy Hall of Famer by performing his hit song,&nbsp;I'm Still Standing. Lovato wore an Elton John-inspired outfit&nbsp;— glitter shades and&nbsp;sparkly suit paired with a pair of white platform boots. They had a great time on stage, with the audience dancing with them as they sang the groovy track.</p><p>One of the most unforgettable moments in that tribute was Lovato's candid interaction with John who was sitting on the side of the stage. The&nbsp;Rocket Man&nbsp;singer was obviously proud and in awe of Lovato's performance. It was as if they were the icon being honored that night as John sat there watching them own the stage like a fanboy. Fans of the Skyscraper&nbsp;singer&nbsp;also couldn't help but gush over their "cute" friendship with the elder singer. They said it was adorable seeing the two music icons' friendship play out on stage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a class=bc-title-link title="Has Demi Lovato Spoken To Former BFF Selena Gomez Since Her Near-Fatal Overdose?" href=#>Has Demi Lovato Spoken To Former BFF Selena Gomez Since Her Near-Fatal Overdose?</a></span></p><h2 id=elton-john-supports-demi-lovato-s-openness-about-their-journey-but-not-their-being-california-sober>Elton John Supports Demi Lovato's Openness About Their Journey But Not Their Being 'California Sober'</h2><p>In the docuseries, Demi Lovato revealed that they are currently "California sober" or taking a "moderation" approach to sobriety. "I had had it drilled into my head for so many years that one drink was equivalent to a crack pipe," they said in the docuseries. "I've been hesitant to share until now that I’ve been smoking weed and drinking in moderation." It sparked a huge controversy that divided even the fans of the&nbsp;Cool for the Summer&nbsp;singer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CBS Sunday Morning interview</a>, Lovato further explained,&nbsp;"I really don't feel comfortable explaining the parameters of my recovery to people, because I don't want anyone to look at my parameters of safety and think that's what works for them, because it might not." They emphasized that they're not encouraging everyone else to try their "moderation" method. "I feel the complete abstinent method isn't a one-size-fits-all solution for everybody, I don't think that this journey of moderation is a one-size-fits-all solution for everybody, too," they added. Elton John strongly disagrees with Lovato's method.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He said, "Moderation doesn't work — sorry," he said in the docuseries.&nbsp;"If you drink, you're going to drink more. If you take a pill, you’re going to take another one. You either do it, or you don't." Many of Lovato's fans agreed with John saying that he's like the only uncle who's there to tell it how it is. But despite the singers' different opinions on sobriety, John still supports Lovato's openness about their personal journey.</p><p>"The great thing about Demi is that [they have] opened up about [their] addictions and [their] problems," he said. "And the stress and the pressure of fame at such an early age. A lot of people are afraid to open up about it." Elton John is that good friend who's not going to sugarcoat things for you but will be there every step of the way to support you no matter what. We're sure that's one of the things Demi Lovato appreciates about him.</p><p class=p-count-8><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Demi Lovato, Elliot Page, And Other Celebrities Are Embracing Their Nonbinary Identities" href=#>Demi Lovato, Elliot Page, And Other Celebrities Are Embracing Their Nonbinary Identities</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibnqWZYrmwwsCtpmaZnpl6prjTqKVmop%2Bdu26%2BxKWYraGfo8Cptc9o</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdemi-lovato-and-elton-john-relationship.html&text=How%20Close%20Are%20Demi%20Lovato%20And%20Elton%20John%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdemi-lovato-and-elton-john-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdemi-lovato-and-elton-john-relationship.html&title=How%20Close%20Are%20Demi%20Lovato%20And%20Elton%20John%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdemi-lovato-and-elton-john-relationship.html&title=How%20Close%20Are%20Demi%20Lovato%20And%20Elton%20John%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdemi-lovato-and-elton-john-relationship.html&title=How%20Close%20Are%20Demi%20Lovato%20And%20Elton%20John%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdemi-lovato-and-elton-john-relationship.html&description=How%20Close%20Are%20Demi%20Lovato%20And%20Elton%20John%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./paul-menard-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Paul Menard Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./drake-future-desires-lyrics.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Drake &amp;amp; Future  Desires Lyrics">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
