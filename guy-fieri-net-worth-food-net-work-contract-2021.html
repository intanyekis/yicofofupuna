On top of having to be good at cooking, TV chefs also need to have a personality that viewers can invest in as evidenced by the careers of people like Julia Child and Wolfgang Puck. Still, even though most people who cook on TV are likable, they also tend to carry themselves like they are better than their viewers. In some ways, that makes sense since <a href=#>many TV chefs are worth a fortune</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Guy Fieri’s Wife Really Thinks About His Greasy Diet</a></span></p><p>Unlike most of his peers, Guy Fieri has always felt special because he seems like a regular guy who happens to be an exceptionally talented chef. For that reason, so many people love seeing Guy on TV that the Food Network has been willing to <a href=#>pay Fieri millions to host a slew of different shows</a> over the years. Unsurprisingly, that has allowed Fieri to become extremely rich over his lengthy career. Despite that, Fieri managed to pull off something incredible, he became much wealthier during the pandemic.</p><h2 id=guy-fieri-rsquo-s-unlikely-rise-to-fame>Guy Fieri’s Unlikely Rise To Fame</h2><p>These days, most kids who are 10-years-old spend their time doing things like playing video games and watching TV. However, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">when Guy Fieri was 10, he started his first business</a>, a pretzel stand that he bought with his dad in his hometown of Ferndale, California. According to Fieri, he was inspired to start his first business when he was on vacation with his family and bought a pretzel from a vendor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Reason Chef Guy Fieri Decided To Change His Name</a></span></p><p>After growing up and graduating from college with a Bachelor of Science in Hotel Management in 1990, Guy Fieri opted to work as the manager of a restaurant. Several years later, Fieri opened up his first restaurant with a business partner in 1996 and from there he was off to the races. Over the next 25 years, Fieri opened up so many restaurants, many of which were successful, that it is staggering. Despite his success in the business world, Fieri had other aspirations.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Sweet Way Guy Fieri Met His Wife, Lori</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the mid-2000s, the world was introduced to Guy Fieri when he competed on the second season of The Next Food Network Star which he went on to win. Shortly after that, Fieri became a staple of the Food Network with his show Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives becoming an absolute sensation. On top of hosting so many Food Network shows that it was hard for anyone to keep track of them all, Fieri became a pop culture icon. Of course, the main reasons for Fieri’s crossover celebrity are his lovable personality and memorable look. On top of that, Fieri has also become beloved in part because of how much he has embraced the LGBTQ+ community including officiating hundreds of same-sex marriages.</p><h2 id=guy-fieri-signed-a-mind-blowing-new-television-contract>Guy Fieri Signed A Mind-Blowing New Television Contract</h2><p>Since the COVID-19 pandemic first took the world by storm, it has had a catastrophic effect on the world. After all, on top of taking the lives of far too many people, the pandemic has also put many folks out of work. Of course, life is extremely unfair which is why it shouldn’t be too shocking that some people have been enjoyed a lot of success during the pandemic as well. For example, it has become clear that Guy Fieri has monumentally cashed in since the pandemic took over the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Right off the top, it is worth noting that Guy Fieri hasn’t made money from all of the misfortune that others have gone through due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, Fieri’s net worth exploding during the pandemic mostly is coincidental. After all, the reason why Fieri has become so wealthy is that he signed a new contract with the Food Network that reportedly makes him the highest-paid TV chef.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Much Does Guy Fieri Make For 'Diners, Drive-Ins, And Dives'?</a></span></p><p>According to reports, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fieri and the Food Network signed an $80 million three-year deal</a> in 2021. Amazingly enough, Fieri’s previous contract only paid him $30 million over the same amount of time which means that he got a $50 million raise which is beyond incredible.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While it is true that there is no indication that Fieri made any attempt to capitalize on the COVID-19 pandemic, it would be silly to pretend his raise was completely unrelated. After all, when people are stuck at home with nothing to do amid global upheaval, watching Fieri do his thing is very comforting. For that reason, it is all but certain that lots of networks were interested in hiring Fieri away from the Food Network.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>8 Lesser-Known Facts About Guy Fieri's New $80 Million Deal With The Food Network</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGierrFdm7amvshmpZ6sXay8s8DHZp2op5Riu6bAjLCmq6NdmLyvwNGamq1lYmV%2Fcns%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fguy-fieri-net-worth-food-net-work-contract-2021.html&text=Here%27s%20How%20Guy%20Fieri%27s%20Net%20Worth%20Exploded%20During%20The%20Pandemic&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fguy-fieri-net-worth-food-net-work-contract-2021.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fguy-fieri-net-worth-food-net-work-contract-2021.html&title=Here%27s%20How%20Guy%20Fieri%27s%20Net%20Worth%20Exploded%20During%20The%20Pandemic" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fguy-fieri-net-worth-food-net-work-contract-2021.html&title=Here%27s%20How%20Guy%20Fieri%27s%20Net%20Worth%20Exploded%20During%20The%20Pandemic" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fguy-fieri-net-worth-food-net-work-contract-2021.html&title=Here%27s%20How%20Guy%20Fieri%27s%20Net%20Worth%20Exploded%20During%20The%20Pandemic" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fguy-fieri-net-worth-food-net-work-contract-2021.html&description=Here%27s%20How%20Guy%20Fieri%27s%20Net%20Worth%20Exploded%20During%20The%20Pandemic" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ice-spice-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ice Spice Net Worth, Wiki, Height, Career, Boyfriend, Age">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./building-an-empire-the-worlds-5-richest-bodybuilders.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Building An Empire: The World's 5 Richest Bodybuilders">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
