But rewind 100 years and they were used mainly — or even exclusively — for boys. So were a lot of other names that are now more female.</p><p><a href=#><u>Unisex names</u></a> are rarely perfectly gender-balanced. They’re usually given more to one gender or the other, and the balance changes over time.</p><p>Sometimes it just takes one famous namesake to tip the name over to the opposite sex. In the 1940s, Hollywood star <b>Lauren </b>Bacall (real name Betty Joan Perske) had an astronomical impact on a rare-but-mostly-male name. More recent influencers turning <a href=#><u>boy names</u></a> into girl names include <b>Reese </b>Witherspoon, <b>Sutton </b>Foster, and <b>Madison</b> the mermaid (played by Daryl Hannah) in <i>Splash</i>.</p><p>Meanwhile, some names switch gender because of a gradual change in fashionable sounds. <b>Emery</b>, and later <b>Avery</b>, became more viable as <a href=#><u>girl names</u></a> with the rise in popularity of Emily, Emma, and Ava.</p><p>Here, we take a look at names that were <b>once 100% male, but are now mainly female</b>, using the USA’s <a href=#><u>most popular baby names 2022</u></a>.</p><h3>Names Now All Female</h3><p>These names used to be all male, but are now 100% female. They were given to 0-4 boys in 2022, so they aren’t on the charts. Most are somewhat dated for girls, too:</p><p>Some names on this list are still unisex in use, like <b>Emerson </b>and <b>Finley</b>, while others are now almost exclusively given to girls, like <b>Addison </b>and <b>Hadley</b>. Most names here are surnames and place names, a style that is particularly gender-fluid.</p><p>Here, some of the most <a href=#><u>popular girl names</u></a> that were once 100% male, along with the year they moved permanently to a girl majority.</p><h2>Unisex Names That Changed from Boy to Girl</h2><h4>A to D</h4><p><b>Addison</b>: 98% female in 2022.
